This file contains a list of BSP maintainers for the BSPs contained in
the meta-lsi repository.

Please submit any patches against meta-lsi BSPs to the Yocto mailing
list (yocto@yoctoproject.org).

If you have problems with or questions about a particular BSP, feel
free to contact the maintainer directly (cc:ing the Yocto mailing list
puts it in the archive and helps other people who might have the same
questions in the future), but please try to do the following first:

  - look in the Yocto Project Bugzilla
    (http://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/) to see if a problem has
    already been reported

  - look through recent entries of the Yocto mailing list archives
    (https://lists.yoctoproject.org/pipermail/yocto/) to see if other
    people have run into similar problems or had similar questions
    answered.

Descriptions of section entries:

	M: Mail patches to: FullName <address@domain>
	F: Files and directories with wildcard patterns.
	   A trailing slash includes all files and subdirectory files.
	   F:	meta-crownbay/	all files in and below meta-crownbay
	   F:	meta-crownbay/*	all files in meta-crownbay, but not below
	   One pattern per line.  Multiple F: lines acceptable.

Please keep this list in alphabetical order.
